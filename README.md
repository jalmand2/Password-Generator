# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

In this assignment, I wrote the JavaScript code in order to properly execute a Password Generator application. The overall goal was to create a functioning application that generates a password based off of different values like password length and whether or not it contained distinguishing features like special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters or numeric values.
